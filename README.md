Human Breathing Simulator
The Human Breathing Simulator is a Python-based software package that can simulate the process of human ventilation. It is based on fundamental medical principles and uses established formulas to calculate ideal body weight, tidal volume, and minute ventilation.

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HumanBreathingSimulator.git
Requirements
Python 3.7 or above
Usage
Running the Simulator
You can run the simulator using the provided Python script:

Copy code
python run_simulation.py
When running the simulator, you will be prompted to input:

Height (in inches)

Age (in years)
Sex (either 'male' or 'female')

Respiratory rate (breaths per minute)

The simulator will then calculate and display the ideal body weight, tidal volume, and minute ventilation based on these parameters.

## Demonstration
Here is a sample of the output you can expect from the program:

---

Enter your height in inches: 70
Enter your age in years: 30
Enter your sex (male/female): male
Enter your respiratory rate (breaths per minute): 15

---

Calculating your ideal body weight...
Your ideal body weight is: 63.7 kg

Calculating your tidal volume...
Your tidal volume is: 478.1 mL/breath

Calculating your minute ventilation...
Your minute ventilation is: 7.2 L/min

Calculating your normal minute ventilation range...
Your normal minute ventilation range is: 4.6 - 10.2 L/min
